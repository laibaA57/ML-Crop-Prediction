# ML-Crop-Prediction
#This Crop Prediction project uses Machine Learning to help farmers and agricultural planners choose the most suitable crop based on environmental conditions like soil nutrients (N, P, K), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall. The model is trained using real-world agricultural data and deployed through a simple Flask web app. Users can enter their local data through a user-friendly interface, and the app instantly predicts the best crop to grow. The project combines machine learning, Python, Flask, and web development to offer a practical solution for smarter, data-driven farming.
